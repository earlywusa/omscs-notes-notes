- B. Source Routing Attacks
- C. Tiny Fragment Attack
- D. Stateful inspection Attack

<details open>
<summary>Answer</summary>

D

**Source**

Packet filtering firewall countermeasures are A,B,C

IP Address Spoofing countermeasures: Discard packets with an inside source address if the packet arrives on an external interface

Source Routing Attacks: Discards all packets in which the source destinations specifies to the route

Tiny Fragment Attack: Enforcing a rule that the first fragment of a packet must contain a predefined minimum amount of the transport header.

In textbook

IP address spoofing: The intruder transmits packets from the outside with a source IP address field containing an address of an internal host. The attacker hopes that the use of a spoofed address will allow penetration of systems that employ simple source address security, in which packets from specific trusted internal hosts are accepted. The countermeasure is to discard packets with an inside source address if the packet arrives on an external interface. In fact, this countermeasure is often implemented at the router external to the firewall.

Source routing attacks: The source station specifies the route that a packet should take as it crosses the Internet, in the hopes that this will bypass security measures that do not analyze the source routing information. A countermeasure is to discard all packets that use this option.

Tiny fragment attacks: The intruder uses the IP fragmentation option to create extremely small fragments and force the TCP header information into a separate packet fragment. This attack is designed to circumvent filtering rules that depend on TCP header information. Typically, a packet filter will make a filtering decision on the first fragment of a packet. All subsequent fragments of that packet are filtered out solely on the basis that they are part of the packet whose first fragment was rejected. The attacker hopes the filtering firewall examines only the first fragment and the remaining fragments are passed through. A tiny fragment attack can be defeated by enforcing a rule that the first fragment of a packet must contain a predefined minimum amount of the transport header. If the first fragment is rejected, the filter can remember the packet and discard all subsequent fragments.

IP Address and Protocol Values-This controls access based on the source and destination IP address and port numbers, direction of flow (either inbound or outbound). This type of filtering is used with packet filter and stateful inspection firewall designs. This practice is used to limit access to a specific service.
Application Protocol- This controls access on the basis of authorized application protocol data. This type of filtering is used by application-level-gateway that relays and monitors the exchange of information for specific application protocols (for example SMTP, HTTP (email and web requests) for authorized users)
User Identity- Controls Access based on user identity typically for inside users who identity themselves use secure authentication such as IPSec
Network Activity- Controls the access based on: time or request such as only during businesss hours, rate of request etc.

**Source**

this is a limitation of the firewall Page 291
A firewall defines a single choke point that attempts to keep unauthorized users out of the protected network, prohibit potentially vulnerable services from entering or leaving the network, and provide protection from various kinds of IP spoofing and routing attacks. The use of a single choke point simplifies security management because security capabilities are consolidated on a single system or set of systems.
A firewall provides a location for monitoring security-related events. Audits and alarms can be implemented on the firewall system.
A firewall is a convenient platform for several Internet functions that are not security related. These include a network address translator, which maps local addresses to Internet addresses, and a network management function that audits or logs Internet usage.
A firewall can serve as the platform for IPSec. Using the tunnel mode capability described in Chapter 22, the firewall can be used to implement virtual private networks.
Firewalls have their limitations, including the following:
The firewall cannot protect against attacks that bypass the firewall. Internal systems may have wired or mobile broadband capability to connect to an ISP. An internal LAN may have direct connections to peer organizations that bypass the firewall.
The firewall may not protect fully against internal threats, such as a disgruntled employee or an employee who unwittingly cooperates with an external attacker.
An improperly secured wireless LAN may be accessed from outside the organization. An internal firewall that separates portions of an enterprise network cannot guard against wireless communications between local systems on different sides of the internal firewall.
A laptop, PDA, or portable storage device may be used and infected outside the corporate network, then attached and used internally.

What is the correct order for how an attacker behaves during intrusion:

- A. Marinating Access this is important because an attack may not be a onetime action they may install backdoors or other malicious software on a target system so they can continue to access.

- B. Information Gathering System Exploit this is when an attacker has already gained sufficient privilege on a system and he or she can find out more about the network and the organization or even move to another target system to further exploit on the network.

- C. Covering Tracks: This is when the user makes sure there is no evidence of them on the system this can be done by disabling or even editing the system audit logs to remove evidence of attack activities. Alternatively, the user can install a root kit to hide the installed malware.

- D. Privilege Escalation this is taken after initial access ad the attacker will try to use a local exploit to escalate its privilege form from normal user to root on target system.

- E. Initial Access this is accomplished by exploiting a remote network vulnerability.

- F. Target acquisition and information gathering this is when the attacker identifies the target system using publicly available information both technical and non-technical and they also use network tools to analyze target resources.

Deep learning is not part of the IDS logical component the IDS is composed of the following
Sensors: Sensors are responsible for collecting data. The input for a sensor may be any part of a system that could contain evidence of an intrusion. Types of input to a sensor includes network packets, log files, and system call traces. Sensors collect and forward this information to the analyzer.

Analyzers: Analyzers receive input from one or more sensors or from other analyzers. The analyzer is responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred. The output of this component is an indication that an intrusion has occurred. The output may include evidence supporting the conclusion that an intrusion occurred. The analyzer may provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion. The sensor inputs may also be stored for future analysis and review in a storage or database component.

User interface: The user interface to an IDS enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system. In some systems, the user interface may equate to a manager, director, or console component.

> Thus, a loose interpretation of intruder behavior, which will catch more intruders, will also lead to a number of false positives, or false alarms, where authorized users are identified as intruders. On the other hand, an attempt to limit false positives by a tight interpretation of intruder behavior will lead to an increase in false negatives, or intruders not identified as intruders.

There are two schemes to attack a symmetric encryption scheme. What are they?

- A. Cryptanalysis & Brute-Force attacks
- B. Cryptanalysis & DDoS
- C. Brute-force attack and CipherText
- D. Cryptanalysis & Caesar

<details open>
<summary>Answer</summary>

A

There are two general approaches to attacking a symmetric encryption scheme. The first attack is known as cryptanalysis. Cryptanalytic attacks rely on the nature of the algorithm plus perhaps some knowledge of the general characteristics of the plaintext, or even some sample plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This type of attack exploits the characteristics of the algorithm to attempt to deduce a specific plaintext or to deduce the key being used. If the attack succeeds in deducing the key, the effect is catastrophic: All future and past messages encrypted with that key are compromised.

The second method, known as the brute-force attack, is to try every possible key on a piece of ciphertext until an intelligible translation into plaintext is obtained.

While the Pigeonhole Principle says there exist collisions, the collision resistance property says that it is computationally infeasible to find them. So even though collisions exist, they are hard to find, thus keeping the collision resistance property of hashes intact.

From the birthday "paradox", if the length of the hash is _x_ bits, then a hacker would have to search 2^(x/2) messages in order to find a collision. In doing so, what is the probability, approximately, that the hacker will find a collision?

- A. nearly 100%

D

The approximate 2^(n/2) = sqrt(2^n) gives the probability of about 50% that the hacker will find at least 1 match.

So it's misleading to say that the hacker would have to search 2^(n/2) messages to "find a match". This would only give the hacker better than 50% chance of finding it without some more strategic choices.
